# 1. Guide 🌎

This library was built on the foundation of the [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) and [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) libraries.

This library provides the ability to automatically generate class objects supported by the [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) library **directly from JSON files**.

Show some ❤️ and star the repo to support the project.

> **Note**</br>
> Many of the specifications in this library are still in development. Your contributions are very welcome!

## 1.1. Motivation 💎

- Realize JSON-based model design.
- Realize automatic generation of model objects from design.
- Synchronize the design and implementation of model objects.
- Expand the possibilities of the freezed library even more.
- etc...

## 1.2. Getting Started 🏄

### 1.2.1. Prerequisite

The codes automatically generated by this library depend on [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) and [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed).

So, let's add the prerequisite libraries to `pubspec.yaml` as follows.

```yaml
dependencies:
  json_annotation: latest
  freezed_annotation: latest

dev_dependencies:
  json_serializable: latest
  freezed: latest
```

### 1.2.2. Install Library

Next, let's install the libraries to use the **freezer** functionality.

**With Dart:**

```bash
dart pub add freezer
```

**With Flutter:**

```bash
flutter pub add freezer
```

### 1.2.3. Create a JSON File

**freezer** interprets JSON files as design information and automatically generates object classes supported by the [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) library.

And you need to note following rules when you use the `freezer`.

1. **freezer** parses files with the `.freezer.json` extension.
2. **freezer** parses JSON files stored in the `.design` folder.

So, now let's create a JSON file with the following structure as a trial.

```json
{
  "shop": {
    "name.!required": "My Fancy Shop",
    "product.!as:products": [
      {
        "name": "Chocolate",
        "price": 5.99,
        "product_type": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "Gummy",
        "price": 8.99
      }
    ],
    "closed": false
  }
}
```

And then store this JSON file in the `.design` folder of the root of project.

```bash
.
├── analysis_options.yaml
├── design
│   └── sample
│       └── shop.freezer.json
├── lib
├── pubspec.lock
└── pubspec.yaml
```

### 1.2.4. Execute Command

Now let's execute the following command and see what happens!

```bash
dart pub run freezer:main
```

Then, this trial is successful if the following output is obtained.

```bash
Started process for 1 files

[INFO] Reading cached asset graph completed, took 28ms
[INFO] Checking for updates since last build completed, took 297ms
[INFO] Running build completed, took 4.0s
[INFO] Caching finalized dependency graph completed, took 19ms
[INFO] Succeeded after 4.1s with 0 outputs (3 actions)

┗━━ 6 files in 5.5022 seconds
```

And you can see generated dart codes in the `.lib` folder like below.

```bash
.
├── analysis_options.yaml
├── design
│   └── sample
│       └── shop.freezer.json
├── lib
│   └── sample
│       ├── products.dart
│       ├── products.freezed.dart
│       ├── products.g.dart
│       ├── shop.dart
│       ├── shop.freezed.dart
│       └── shop.g.dart
├── pubspec.lock
└── pubspec.yaml
```

## 1.3. Contribution 🏆
